# Core_JAVA_Find_Value_Array
Create an integer array of length 10 and fill it up with random numbers.
Print the values in the array for the user to see.

Ask the user for a value they'd like you to search for.
Search through the array.
If the value is in the array, tell them which position you found.

It's okay if the program prints the message more than once.
